Just a repository
I am a PhD student of public affairs and policy at the Hatfield School of Government in Portland Oregon. I am interested in the utility of big data aplications in policy analyisis and evaluation research, particularly GIS and predictive analytics. I am a Gen X'er, so I have just the right amount of trust and faith in technology to hold my interest in the topic. I have experience with SPSS, but need to learn more about what is out there.
